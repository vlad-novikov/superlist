## You can try Web version of this app [here](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Flutter2GoogleSheets-Demo/demo/).

## üí° Introduction
- [***Google Sheets***](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) is a very powerful tool üî• if we look into deep in it. 
- It provides us interface using [***Google AppScript***](https://script.google.com/) so that we can do various types of operations on Google Spreadsheet. 
- We can perform all types of operations like Reading/Inserting/Updating/Deleting using AppScript on Google Sheets. It's so much powerful and capable that we can even use Google Sheets as a backend of our application üì≤.
- Here we'll develop a sample flutter application, which simply takes user User Feedback, makes HTTP request to Google AppScript and AppScript then stores that feedback in Google Sheets.
- In other screen, we'll show feedback responses fetched from Google sheets into the List.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Project Files
- [**Flutter Application**](lib/) - Flutter Application Code.
- [**AppScript Code**](code.gs) - Google AppScript code to deploy as Web app for interface between Flutter app and Google sheet.

## What's Happening? ü§î
In flutter, when submit button is pressed, `HTTP` `POST` request is called on AppScript `URL` which retireves parameter from request and then appends row data in Google Sheets. Thus, data from flutter in inserted into Google Sheets.
When `GET` request is sent to the same URL, it returns the List of feedback responses.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Results
You can run this app on web [here](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Flutter2GoogleSheets-Demo/demo/)

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Main Feedback Form</th>
    <th>Feedback Responses List</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/main.PNG"/></td>
    <td><img src="images/responses.PNG"/></td> 
  </tr>
</table>

**Google Sheet Preview:**:

As you can see, In first image, When *Submit Feedback* button is Clicked then that feedback is stored in *Google Sheet* as in Second image.
Hurrah!üòç thus we have successfully implemented Google Sheets with Flutter.
